## ❌ The Problem

Bank’s corporate loan platform was facing:

- High defect leakage into UAT and production
- Lack of end-to-end test coverage across modules like Origination, Underwriting, and Repayment
- Inconsistent QA documentation across teams
- Time-consuming manual regression with no automation in place

---

## 🔧 The QA Solution (My Role)

As a **Senior QA Analyst**, I played a key role in designing and executing a comprehensive QA solution.

### ✔️ Key Contributions:
- Analyzed complex loan workflows and coordinated with BAs and developers to identify test scenarios
- Designed 200+ functional and regression test cases across Origination, Approval, Disbursement, and Payment modules
- Performed backend data validation using **SQL** for financial transactions and loan schedules
- Conducted **API testing** using **Postman** for loan status, disbursement, and payment services
- Managed test cycles and defect triage using **JIRA** and **TestRail**
- Provided daily QA dashboards and test summary reports to leadership
- Participated in Agile sprint planning, estimations, and retrospectives

## 🧰 Tools & Tech Used

- **Test Management:** TestRail, JIRA  
- **API Testing:** Postman  
- **Database Validation:** Oracle SQL  
- **Communication:** Confluence, MS Teams  
- **Environment:** QA, UAT, and Pre-Prod for phased testing

## 📈 Results & Impact

| Metric | Before QA Implementation | After QA Implementation |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Defect Leakage | ~40% in UAT | <10% in UAT |
| Regression Time | 4 days | 2 days |
| UAT Sign-off Delay | Frequent | 95% on-time |
| QA Coverage | 50% documented | 95% documented |

- Improved stakeholder confidence through structured QA artifacts  
- Reduced defect fix turnaround time by 30%  
- Ensured timely go-lives of loan modules during multiple release cycles
